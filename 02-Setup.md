Setting Up Your System to Use Sauce with Java
=====

We recommend using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) to build your project and either the [JUnit](http://www.junit.org) or the [TestNG](http://www.testng.org) libraries to write Selenium tests. 

While neither Maven, JUnit nor TestNG are required
to use Sauce, this is the framework that we'll use for this tutorial.

Although this tutorial is not a comprehensive guide for getting Java and Maven set up on
your system, here are some guidelines:

<!-- SAUCE:INCLUDE:maven_setup -->

You're all set up!
